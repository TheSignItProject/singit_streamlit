# SingIt! 🎤 Singer Voice Transformation Streamlit App

This repository contains the code for the **Streamlit** web page of the **SingIt!** project – a singing voice transformation system.

## 📝 About the Project
**SingIt!** enables conversion of spoken voice into singing voice using **zero-shot, many-to-many style transfer**. The system combines simple components, including a modified autoencoder, to tackle the complex task of singer voice synthesis. It allows anyone to "sing" any song with natural-sounding results.
